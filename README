# linux-utils

**linux-utils** is a collection of command-line utilities inspired by classic Unix/Linux tools.  
The project's goal is to provide simple, readable, and portable implementations of essential commands — useful both for learning purposes and everyday use.

## Available Commands

### `cat`

The `cat` (concatenate) command reads one or more files and prints their contents to standard output.  
It is commonly used to display file contents, concatenate multiple files, or redirect content.

#### Usage

```sh
linux-utils cat file1.txt file2.txt
cd
The cd (change directory) command changes the current working directory.
It is used to navigate between directories.

⚠️ Note: Due to the nature of how processes work in Unix/Linux, a standalone compiled cd command cannot change the current directory of the calling shell.
This is intended for educational purposes or to be used inside custom shells.

Usage
sh
Copia
Modifica
linux-utils cd /path/to/directory
Build Instructions
To compile the utilities:

sh
Copia
Modifica
make
Each command will be compiled into its own binary inside the bin/ directory (or current directory depending on your Makefile).
